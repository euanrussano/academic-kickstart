    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous post of this series (see [here](/post/hydro_power/02lake_modelling)), I showed how to develop a mathematical model that can mimic the dynamic behaviour of lakes (hydro reservoirs). In this post I will show how to develop a mathematical representation of the reaches (river sections) in the hydro-power system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mathematical development is a bit more complex than the last one. It will require the incorporation of the De Saint Venant Equations and some spatial discretization to translate a partial differential equation (PDE) into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, it is enough to consider one dimensional hydraulics with constant fluid density, thus neglecting the effects on other coordinates that are not in the same direction as the river flow."
